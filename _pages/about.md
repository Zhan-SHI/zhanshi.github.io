Hi and Welcome. 

I am a fully-funded PhD student in Economics at the University of Strathclyde starting from Oct. 2021. I am under the supervision of Dr Jonathan Norris and Dr Agnese Romiti.

My research interests lie in applied microeconomics, labour economics, education, inequality. 

I hold an MSc in Economics from the University of Edinburgh and a Bachelor of Economics in International Economics and Trade from Shanghai International Studies University.

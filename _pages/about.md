Hi and Welcome. 

I am a fully-funded PhD student in Economics at the University of Strathclyde starting from Oct, 2021. I am under the supervision of <a href="https://jonathan-norris.github.io/" style="color: #3776ab; text-decoration: underline;text-decoration-style: solid;">Dr Jonathan Norris</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/agneseromiti/home" style="color: #202A44; text-decoration: underline;text-decoration-style: solid;">Dr Agnese Romiti</a>.

My research interests lie in applied microeconomics, labour economics, education, and inequality. 

I hold an MSc in Economics from the University of Edinburgh and a Bachelor of Economics in International Economics and Trade from Shanghai International Studies University.

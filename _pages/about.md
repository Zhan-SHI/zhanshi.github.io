Hi and Welcome. 

I am a fully-funded PhD student in Economics at the University of Strathclyde starting from Oct, 2021. I am under the supervision of [Dr Jonathan Norris](https://jonathan-norris.github.io/) and [Dr Agnese Romiti](https://sites.google.com/view/agneseromiti/home).

My research interests lie in applied microeconomics, labour economics, education, and inequality. 

I hold an MSc in Economics from the University of Edinburgh and a Bachelor of Economics in International Economics and Trade from Shanghai International Studies University.

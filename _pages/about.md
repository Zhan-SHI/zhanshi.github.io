Hello and Welcome to my website!

I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the School of Economics at the University of Kent. I am on the job market 2024-2025. Here you can find my [CV](/assets/files/ZhanShi_CV.pdf). 

I received my PhD in Economics from the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow in 2024. I hold an MSc in Economics from the University of Edinburgh. My research interests lie in applied microeconomics, labour economics, education, and behavioural economics.

## Working Papers 
<!-- - - - -->

Income Inequality and Peer Effects in Education (with [Marco Fongoni](https://sites.google.com/site/marcofongoni/home), [Jonathan Norris](https://jonathan-norris.github.io/), and [Agnese Romiti](https://sites.google.com/view/agneseromiti/home)). 2022. *Under review.*<br/>

<div id="peer-inequality" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
We study the long-run effects of income inequality within peer compositions. An increase in the share of low-income peers within school-cohorts improves the educational outcomes of low-income students and negatively affects high-income students. We show this pattern is not likely explained by commonly observed mechanisms. We then propose a model based on reference-dependent preferences and social comparison that rationalizes our findings, highlighting the role of frustration or motivation depending on students' relative income. We also provide evidence consistent with this mechanism. Finally, we show that better connections in school can help to avoid such unintended consequences of income inequality.

Beliefs on Children’s Human Capital Accumulation and Mothers at Work (with [Césarine Boinet](https://cesarine-boinet.github.io/), [Jonathan Norris](https://jonathan-norris.github.io/), [Agnese Romiti](https://sites.google.com/view/agneseromiti/home), and [Paul Telemo](https://sites.google.com/view/paultelemo/home)). *Draft available upon request.*


The One-Child Policy in China and its Intergenerational Effects on Health (with Thi Tham Ta). *Draft available upon request.*<br/>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('ocp')">Abstract</a> ] </small>

<div id="ocp" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
We study the spillover effects of China's one-child policy on the health outcomes of subsequent generations. Despite extensive research on the effects of family size on education, few studies have examined the policy's effects on health, especially across generations. Focusing on urban Han Chinese from the China Family Panel Studies data, we use a reduced form regression discontinuity design (RDD) to isolate the local average treatment effect of the policy. The results indicate that children of policy-affected parents show significant improvements in physical and mental health, which can be attributed to increased parental investment and care and improved parental health outcomes. Our findings contribute to the literature on the intergenerational transmission of health and quantity-quality trade-offs, and highlight how family planning policies can have lasting health effects across generations.

Gender impacts of face-to-face academic interactions: Evidence from conferences (with [Fernanda Leite Lopez de Leon](https://sites.google.com/site/fernandalldeleon/) and [Ben McQuillin](https://research-portal.uea.ac.uk/en/persons/ben-mcquillin))<br/>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('gender_conf')">Abstract</a> ] </small>

<div id="gender_conf" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
We explore the role of face-to-face and social interactions in academic settings in contributing to (or mitigating) gender differences in academic productivity. Our focus is on academic conferences, building on our previous work. In exploiting a “natural experiment” (the last-minute cancellation of a very large conference), we showed distinct conference benefits in terms of developing and advertising papers presented, and in authors’ forming new collaborations. More recently, we have discovered that these benefits appear to be gendered. We now propose to develop our existing dataset (comprising more than 29,000 conference papers) and conduct further analyses that will help us to verify, explore, and explain this phenomenon. The conference setting represents a specific opportunity for academics to meet in person. We contend that an understanding of the role of gender in this environment will cast light on the role of gender in academic workplaces more generally.

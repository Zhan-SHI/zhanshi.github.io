Hello and Welcome to my website!

I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the School of Economics at the University of Kent. I am on the job market 2024-2025. Here you can find my [CV](/assets/files/ZhanShi_CV.pdf). 

I received my PhD in Economics from the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow in 2024. I hold an MSc in Economics from the University of Edinburgh. My research interests lie in applied microeconomics, labour economics, education, and behavioural economics.

Income Inequality and Peer Effects in Education (with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/marcofongoni/home" class="no-underline">Marco Fongoni</a>, <a href="https://jonathan-norris.github.io/" class="no-underline">Jonathan Norris</a>, and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/agneseromiti/home" class="no-underline">Agnese Romiti</a>). 2022. *Under review.*<br/>

<div id="peer-inequality" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
We study the long-run effects of income inequality within peer compositions. An increase in the share of low-income peers within school-cohorts improves the educational outcomes of low-income students and negatively affects high-income students. We show this pattern is not likely explained by commonly observed mechanisms. We then propose a model based on reference-dependent preferences and social comparison that rationalizes our findings, highlighting the role of frustration or motivation depending on students' relative income. We also provide evidence consistent with this mechanism. Finally, we show that better connections in school can help to avoid such unintended consequences of income inequality.

Beliefs on Children’s Human Capital Accumulation and Mothers at Work (with <a href="https://cesarine-boinet.github.io/" class="no-underline">Césarine Boinet</a>, <a href="https://jonathan-norris.github.io/" class="no-underline">Jonathan Norris</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/agneseromiti/home" class="no-underline">Agnese Romiti</a>, and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/paultelemo/home" class="no-underline">Paul Telemo</a>). *Draft available upon request.*<br/>

<div id="beliefs" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
When deciding whether to maintain a career, mothers may face pressure to sort out of the labor market from beliefs on women’s absolute advantage in child-rearing even when their earnings potential equals that of men. Guided by a simple theoretical model to highlight the role of these beliefs and develop a target belief distribution, we design a survey to estimate beliefs on absolute advantage, finding strong evidence for their presence. We experimentally test mechanisms that may underlie these beliefs, showing that with equivalent time available women relative to men are assumed to spend more time on investments with children. This suggests that policy solely focused on equalizing earnings potential may yet fail to close gender gaps and indicates a need to be informative about the outcomes of children when mothers work. We then conduct an information experiment that provides factual information on the performance of children with full-time working mothers. Using a rich set of quantitative measures and qualitative written responses, we find that respondents who initially under-estimated children’s outcomes when mothers work full-time adjust toward accurate perceptions and reduce their expectations of harm becoming less likely to expect lower time investments into children. Our results suggest a role for policy to target channels where individual’s may be misinformed on children’s outcomes when mothers maintain careers.

The One-Child Policy in China and its Intergenerational Effects on Health (with Thi Tham Ta).<br/>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('ocp')">Abstract</a> | [Draft](/assets/files/ZhanShi_JMP_Oct2024.pdf) ] </small>

<div id="ocp" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
We study the spillover effects of China's one-child policy on the health outcomes of subsequent generations. Despite extensive research on the effects of family size on education, few studies have examined the policy's effects on health, especially across generations. Focusing on urban Han Chinese from the China Family Panel Studies data, we use a reduced form regression discontinuity design (RDD) to isolate the local average treatment effect of the policy. The results indicate that children of policy-affected parents show significant improvements in physical and mental health, which can be attributed to increased parental investment and care and improved parental health outcomes. Our findings contribute to the literature on the intergenerational transmission of health and quantity-quality trade-offs, and highlight how family planning policies can have lasting health effects across generations.

Gender impacts of face-to-face academic interactions: Evidence from conferences (with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/fernandalldeleon/" class="no-underline">Fernanda Leite Lopez de Leon</a> and <a href="https://research-portal.uea.ac.uk/en/persons/ben-mcquillin/" class="no-underline">Ben McQuillin</a>).<br/>

<div id="gender_conf" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
We explore the role of face-to-face and social interactions in academic settings in contributing to (or mitigating) gender differences in academic productivity. Our focus is on academic conferences, building on our previous work. In exploiting a “natural experiment” (the last-minute cancellation of a very large conference), we showed distinct conference benefits in terms of developing and advertising papers presented, and in authors’ forming new collaborations. More recently, we have discovered that these benefits appear to be gendered. We now propose to develop our existing dataset (comprising more than 29,000 conference papers) and conduct further analyses that will help us to verify, explore, and explain this phenomenon. The conference setting represents a specific opportunity for academics to meet in person. We contend that an understanding of the role of gender in this environment will cast light on the role of gender in academic workplaces more generally.

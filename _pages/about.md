Hello and Welcome to my website!

I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the School of Economics at the University of Kent. 
<!-- I work with Fernanda on the Leverhulme-funded project "". -->

<!-- I am a PhD student in Economics at the University of Strathclyde starting in Oct 2021. I am under the supervision of [Dr. Jonathan Norris](https://jonathan-norris.github.io/) and [Dr. Agnese Romiti](https://sites.google.com/view/agneseromiti/home). -->

I received my PhD in Economics from the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow in 2024. I hold an MSc in Economics from the University of Edinburgh and a Bachelor of Economics in International Economics and Trade from Shanghai International Studies University, China. 

My research interests lie in applied microeconomics, labour economics, education, and behavioural economics. Here you can find my [CV](/assets/files/ZhanShi_CV.pdf).

<div id="peer-inequality" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
We study the long-run effects of income inequality within peer compositions. An increase in the share of low-income peers within school-cohorts improves the educational outcomes of low-income students and negatively affects high-income students. We show this pattern is not likely explained by commonly observed mechanisms. We then propose a model based on reference-dependent preferences and social comparison that rationalizes our findings, highlighting the role of frustration or motivation depending on students' relative income. We also provide evidence consistent with this mechanism. Finally, we show that better connections in school can help to avoid such unintended consequences of income inequality.
